# TERAPEAKS SCRAPER
So, in short, this is essentially a command line tool to access EBAY's terapeaks API. You can pass in several options to sort, and customise the output containing the data the program generates

## Installation
Other than installing the tool via the distributed .gz zip, you also need to install playwright for the scraping. You have to run `playwright install-deps`.

## First Use.
You have to login to Ebay to access TeraPeaks. So I've packaged a function which launches a browser instance which will persist overtime. Once booted, hit CTRL + L to launch the login prompt. After logged in, you should go back to the terminal, hit enter, and then you should be able to use the scraper tool!

### Conclusion
Thats it! The program pretty much describes itself as you use it. Let me know if you have any issues or requests! you can reach out to me at savondyer9@gmail.com
